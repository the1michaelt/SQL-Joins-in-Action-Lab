# SQLJoinsinAction_Lab

Main Stories
 
(5 points): As a developer, I want to complete all queries in the Joins in Action project.
(10 points): As a developer, I want to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the movie_library database and its containing tables. Make sure to include a snapshot of this ERD in your GitHub repository.
Checklist

Review the Resources outlined below - be sure to have relevant documentation and references open while you develop!
Run through the Setup Setups and get your project ready to begin work.
Watch the Walkthrough - Joins in Action video for clarification on how to complete the assignment and get setup.
Complete the project, one query at a time!
Once you have completed the Joins in Action queries, move onto the ERD creation within the online DrawSQL application.
Submit your personal assignment repository (queries and ERD.png) to Gradebook once complete (covered in the video).

Setup Steps
Download the .zip file for the GitHub repository from the Starter Code Repository Link (above).
Unzip the file on your computer
Open MySQL Workbench and choose your local connection
Go to File > Open SQL Script in the top menu of MySQL Workbench.
In the window that pops up, choose the database_creation_seed_file.sql file from the starter files, then click Open.
Execute all SQL content within the database_creation_seed_file.sql file to create the database and seed the initial data.
Refresh your Schemas tab and double click on the movie_library database to make it the  active schema.
Now, go to File > Open SQL Script in the top menu of MySQL Workbench once again.
In the window that pops up, choose the joins_in_action_starter.sql file from the starter files, then click Open.
You should see the script open in MySQL Workbench with all of the problems written out in SQL comments.
Write your queries underneath the problem they relate to, and execute those queries to check that they give you the expected output!
